# asdf-python

Python plugin for the [asdf][asdf] version manager.

This plugin differs from other Python version managers because it
installs from a precompiled binary instead of compiling from source.

> Binaries are downloaded from [Twuni Releases][releases].

## Requirements

This plugin should work out of the box on Linux operating systems.

## Installing

```
asdf plugin-add python https://github.com/twuni/asdf-python.git
asdf install python latest
```
